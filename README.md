## 0xHacked x OtterSec CTF

We've prepared the test framework so that you can debug the challenge locally.

``` bash
forge test -vv / forge test -vv --match-test [name]
```

For more details, please visit [Exploit.t.sol](https://github.com/0xHackedLabs/ctf/blob/main/test/Exploit.t.sol).

### how to generate the proof via [0xHacked Online Tool](https://www.0xhacked.com/tool)

Take [Random](https://github.com/0xHackedLabs/ctf/tree/main/src/Demo) as an example.

After debugging the exploit.sol locally, open [0xHacked Online Tool](https://www.0xhacked.com/tool).
1. Switch Network to **CTF**
2. According to the [Random Challenge](https://ctf.0xhacked.com/challenges#Random-4), fill in the block number as 3ï¼Œ
3. Upload the exploit.sol
4. Click "Run", once you wait for a few minutes (usually it's up to 4 min), you will be able to download the proof below and submit it to [Random Challenge](https://ctf.0xhacked.com/challenges#Random-4).
